Install FAQ
===========

Prerequisites are not found:
----------------------------

If not done by your bashrc or "module load", you need to export PKG_CONFIG_PATH and/or CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH and/or hints.

Typically, to find PETSc and SLEPc, you need to export:
- export PKG_CONFIG_PATH="/path/to/petsc/local/lib/pkgconfig:${PKG_CONFIG_PATH}"
- export PKG_CONFIG_PATH="/path/to/slepc/local/lib/pkgconfig:${PKG_CONFIG_PATH}"
- export CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH="/path/to/petsc/local:${CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH}"
- export CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH="/path/to/slepc/local:${CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH}"

Typically, if you do not use the Metis library compiled by PETSc, to give a hint to find Metis you need to export:
- export Metis_DIR="/path/to/metis/local"
- export CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH="/path/to/metis/local:${CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH}"

Minimal configuration of PETSc and SLEPc:
-----------------------------------------

- ~/petsc> ./configure --with-mpi=1 --download-mumps --download-scalapack ...
- ~/slepc> ./configure --download-arpack ...

Headers are not found:
----------------------

- STL C++ header: did you install a recent C++ compiler (C++11) and libstdc++-dev ?
- dlfcn.h: did you install libc-dev ?

Symbols are not found when linking:
-----------------------------------

You need to check that all prerequisites are consistent (unless link may break). Typically, the MPI/Boost/Metis installs found by CMake must be the ones used by PETSc and SLEPc.

In the build directory, remove CMakeCache.txt if any. Set environment variables (PKG_CONFIG_PATH, CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH) before running cmake. Check paths are correct in the cmake summary before the build.

Not working on Windows:
-----------------------

Use debian. Windows is not meant to be supported.

Usage FAQ
=========

How to run the test suite:
--------------------------

- make check: builds the test utilities and run the test suite.
- make checkv: does the same as "make check" but with verbosity.
- make test: runs the test suite but don't build the test utilities.

The test suite fails:
---------------------

Did you configure PETSc and SLEPc with the minimal following options:
- ~/petsc> ./configure --with-mpi=1 --download-mumps --download-scalapack ...
- ~/slepc> ./configure --download-arpack ...

The solver diverges:
--------------------

- GenEO is dedicated to SPD matrices: adding -geneo_chk can help to check this.
- Adding -geneo_dbg can help to understand the problem (create debug files globally and/or per domain).

Testing with "too" small matrices and "lots" of domains may fail:
-----------------------------------------------------------------

GenEO is based on local eigen value problems (one per domain). If the A matrix is "too small" and the number of domains is "too big", the local eigen value problems may not be relevant (no physical meaning): the solve may break.

Use "big enough" or "real life" (physical) matrices.
